## Getting started

* Start by exploring the repository. Take a look at how the code and documentation are implemented, which files go where, etc.
* Before beginning your contribution, [Create an issue][issue-guide]. In your issues's description, please describe the addition or change you wish to make. This helps others guide your contribution, and it lets others know what you're working on.

## Adding a project

* Start by reviewing our [coding guidelines][coding-guidelines].

* Commit your changes in logical chunks. Use Git's [interactice rebase][rebase-info]
  feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

* Before you push your changes to GitHub, make sure that your code compiles and runs without any errors or warnings.

* Make sure to add documentation such as images of the hardware, bugs you found, tips you have on debugging, etc.
  This will help students at all levels complete the projects you made and replicate them.
